========================
Purpose of This Document
========================

The purpose behind the OpenMDAO Conversion Guide is to help users of previous
versions of OpenMDAO (versions up to and including 0.13.0) to change their models
over to the new OpenMDAO 1.0.0 design.  This will require some re-thinking and
re-structuring.  If you are new to OpenMDAO, you should be able to start writing
new models, and this guide should not pertain to you.  You should check out our
OpenMDAO User Guide_.

.. _Guide: ../usr-guide/index.html

If you do not have OpenMDAO v 1.0.0 installed, you should first view our Getting
Started Guide_.  Then we would recommend becoming familiar with the new building
blocks of OpenMDAO in the User Guide's 'Design' section

.. _Guide: ../getting-started/index.html

[The idea is to show examples from old OpenMDAO converted into new, perhaps with
side-by-side code, annotated.  Still thinking about the best way to present this.]

Difference in Classes and Structure
===================================

[Clippy vs. Classic, this differs from the Design section in that we are showing
old vs. new rather than just discussing new]

Moving your previous models to OpenMDAO 1.0 may be an arduous process, but it
will be one that we feel will be worth the effort.  If things get confusing or
difficult, we're happy to help.  [Link to forums?  Link to the openmdao tag on
