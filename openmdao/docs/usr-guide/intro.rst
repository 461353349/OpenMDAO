What is OpenMDAO?
-----------------

OpenMDAO is a high-performance computing platform for systems-analysis and
optimization that enables you to heavily decompose your models, making them
easier to build and maintain, while solving them in a tightly-coupled manner
with efficient parallel numerical methods.

Who Uses OpenMDAO?
------------------

[We could list all the different folks who use it regularly, and some examples
of what they use it for.]


What's New in OpenMDAO 1.0?
---------------------------

If you're new to OpenMDAO, then everything is new to you.  If you're an existing
OpenMDAO user, then everything in 1.0 is new to you, also!  The most recent release,
OpenMDAO 1.0 Alpha, is a departure from the versions that
preceded it (OpenMDAO 0.0.1 through 0.13.0).  In fact, OpenMDAO 1.0 is a complete
re-write of the framework from the ground up.  It is incompatible with all previous
versions of OpenMDAO.  Why did we do this?  [Explain in detail the reasons for departure from
old versions.]

This document will first discuss the new structure of OpenMDAO, and the design
decisions that have been made for version 1.0.  Then we'll move on to some
concrete examples of implementing things like a Paraboloid component, and the
Sellar Problem.
